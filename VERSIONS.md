Invalid local versions of a project dependencies may cause problems with running an app locally.

Versions of particular dependencies, that might help you solve the problem, are listed below.
encountered during configuring the project on your machine.

* <b> Flutter </b> >= 2.2.2 | channel stable
* <b> Dart </b> >= 2.13.3
* <b> Go </b> >= 1.16.5
* <b> Docker </b> >= 20.10.7
* <b> Docker-Compose </b> >= 1.29.2

Those versions are of course not required, there is a high possibility that everything would work
with older ones.
